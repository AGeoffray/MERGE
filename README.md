# MERGE
A carpooling app that allows users in the Bay Area to be connected with other drivers and share a commute. Two-person rides ultimately reduce time, costs, and harmful gas emissions from vehicle commutes.

A QUICK GUIDE:

The home icon directs users to their profile page
The pen icon brings users to their account settings, where they can add or update features such as their bio, password, and profile pic
The car icon allows users to browse all pending ride requests from other users
The wheel icon lets users create a ride request of their own
The search bar / magnifying icon let users browse ride requests from other users by a specific location
The green drop icon is for logging out, and will redirect a user to the home page
The gold community icon is for the "about us" tab, which gives the user a quick summary of MERGE's functions and goals, as well as a contact area that allows users to send comments and questions to the owner of MERGE (aka my personal email account)
